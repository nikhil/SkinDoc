#SkinDoc
Melanoma is the most dangerous form of skin cancer, which can be treated from
early detection. Often, the skin can display moles with abnormal coloring/shape which may or may not be a sign of Melanoma. This program is trained on preliminary Melanoma and normal skin images. The user can just upload a picture of his/her skin segment and get fast feedback on whether or not he/she should see the doctor.

#How it works
This program uses unsupervised Machine Learning to classify the skin images. The images are classified through a linear kernel Single Vector Machine.

#Format of image

This program only accepts `.png` or `.jpeg`

#Technologies used

* cv2
* numpy
* sklearn
* scipy
